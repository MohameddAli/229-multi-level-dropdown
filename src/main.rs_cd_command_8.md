Okay, I need to add the 'cd' builtin command to my Rust shell. Let's see how to approach this.

First, the problem says to handle absolute paths in this stage. So the user can type 'cd /some/absolute/path' and the shell should change the directory. Also, error handling for non-existent paths is required.

Looking at the existing code, the builtins are in a HashSet. I should add 'cd' to that list. Wait, but in the code, when a command is a builtin, it's handled in the match statement. So I need to add a case for 'cd' in the match.

So in the main loop, where commands are matched, add a new arm for "cd". The code for 'cd' will take the first argument as the path. If there's no argument, maybe default to the home directory, but the problem says this stage is for absolute paths, so maybe the test will only check cases where an argument is provided.

Wait, the test example shows 'cd /usr/local/bin' and then 'cd /does_not_exist'. So the first argument is the directory to change to. So I need to check if the user provided a path. If not, perhaps return an error, but according to the problem description, maybe that's handled in later stages. For now, focus on absolute paths with an argument.

So, in the 'cd' case, extract the directory from parts[1]. Then use std::env::set_current_dir to change the directory. If that returns an error, print the error message in the specified format: "cd: <path>: No such file or directory".

Wait, but how to get the error message? The error from set_current_dir is an io::Error. So we can match the error kind. For example, if the error is NotFound, then print the message. But the problem states to print exactly "cd: <directory>: No such file or directory" regardless of the specific error. Or maybe just capture the error's message.

Wait, in the test example, the error message is "cd: /does_not_exist: No such file or directory". So the format is "cd: {path}: {error message}". But the problem says the message should be exactly "No such file or directory" when the path is invalid. Hmm, maybe in Rust, the error for a non-existent directory would be io::ErrorKind::NotFound, and the message would be "No such file or directory". So we can check the error kind and format accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to display the OS's error message. But the sample shows "No such file or directory", which is the standard message for that error.

But how to get the error message as a string? The io::Error has a .to_string() method that gives the error description.

So when the set_current_dir returns an error, we can print "cd: {}: {}", path, error.to_string().

But let's check the test example: the error message is "No such file or directory". So when the directory doesn't exist, the error from set_current_dir would have that message. So using error.to_string() should work.

So the steps are:

1. Add 'cd' to the builtins HashSet.

Wait, the current code has a HashSet of builtins. Wait, no, looking back at the code the user provided in the last message:

In the main function, the builtins are initialized as:

let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type", "pwd"].iter().cloned().collect();

So to add 'cd', we need to include it in this list. Wait, but in the existing code, the builtins are checked in the '_ =>' arm. Wait, let me check the code structure.

In the code, after the match command, there's:

match command {

"exit" => ...,

"echo" => ...,

"type" => ...,

"pwd" => ...,

_ => {

if builtins.contains(command) {

println!("{}: command not found", command);

continue;

}

// rest of the code for external commands

}

}

Wait, no. Wait, in the code, the match is on the command variable. For example, in the code:

match command {

"exit" => {

// handle exit

}

"echo" => {

// handle echo

}

"type" => {

// handle type

}

"pwd" => {

// handle pwd

}

_ => {

// check if it's a builtin, but I think in the code, the '_' arm is for non-builtin commands. Wait no, looking at the code:

In the '_' arm, the code checks if the command is in builtins, and if so, prints "command not found". Wait, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the code's '_' arm is:

_ => {

if builtins.contains(command) {

println!("{}: command not found", command);

continue;

}

// rest of the code to handle external commands

}

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the command is in builtins, like 'exit' or 'echo', it's already matched in the specific arms. So the '_' arm is for commands that are not any of the specific ones. Then, the code checks if the command is a builtin (but how?), but that seems wrong.

Wait, no. The code's builtins HashSet includes all the builtin commands. Then, in the '_' arm, if the command is in builtins, it prints "command not found". But that would only happen if the command is in builtins but not handled in any of the specific match arms. Which would be a bug. Because, for example, 'exit' is in the builtins and is handled in a specific arm, so the '_' arm is not triggered.

Wait, the code's structure is:

The match command checks for "exit", "echo", "type", "pwd". All other commands go to the '_' arm. In the '_' arm, the code checks if the command is in builtins (which includes "exit", "echo", "type", "pwd"), but since those are already handled in the specific arms, this check is redundant. Unless the code is expecting new builtins to be added but not handled in the match.

But that's a problem. For example, if I add 'cd' to the builtins HashSet but forget to add a match arm for it, then the code in the '_' arm would print "cd: command not found", which is incorrect.

So the code's structure is a bit error-prone. However, according to the code provided by the user, when adding a new builtin, they should add a match arm for it, and include it in the builtins HashSet. So for 'cd', we need to add it to the builtins and handle it in a new match arm.

So, steps:

1. Add 'cd' to the builtins HashSet.

In the main function:

let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type", "pwd", "cd"].iter().cloned().collect();

2. Add a new match arm for "cd" to handle changing directories.

In the match command block:

"cd" => {

// handle cd command

}

Now, implement the 'cd' handling.

The 'cd' command can have one argument: the directory to change to. For this stage, we handle absolute paths. So parts[1] is the path.

But need to handle the case where the user provides no arguments. According to the problem, this stage is for absolute paths, but perhaps the test cases will check for that. Wait, the problem says "cd can receive multiple argument types. In this challenge we'll cover: Absolute paths". So perhaps the 'cd' command in this stage must handle when an absolute path is provided as the argument. If the user runs 'cd' without arguments, maybe that's handled in a later stage (like changing to home directory). But according to the current problem statement, maybe the test cases will not cover that, but the code should not crash.

So in code:

In the "cd" arm:

Check if parts has at least two elements (command and path). If not, perhaps print an error message, but according to the problem's test example, the error message is printed when the directory is invalid.

But according to the test example, when the user runs 'cd /does_not_exist', the error message is printed. So, if the user runs 'cd' without arguments, what's the expected behavior? For this stage, maybe the problem doesn't test that. But we need to handle the case where the argument is missing.

But according to the problem's notes, this stage is for absolute paths, so maybe the test cases will always provide an argument. However, the code should handle the case where the user provides no argument. For example, in standard shells, 'cd' with no arguments changes to the home directory. But since this stage is about absolute paths, perhaps the code can return an error if no argument is given, but the problem's test may not check that. However, the problem's sample shows the error message when the directory is invalid, not when the argument is missing. So perhaps the code should check if an argument exists.

So in code:

Inside the "cd" arm:

if parts.len() < 2 {

eprintln!("cd: missing argument");

continue;

}

But wait, according to the test example, when the path is invalid, the error is printed as "cd: /does_not_exist: No such file or directory". So the code should check if the directory exists and is a directory, then change to it. Otherwise, print the error.

So, in code:

let path = parts[1];

Then, use std::env::set_current_dir(path). If that returns an error, print the error message.

So:

"cd" => {

if parts.len() < 2 {

eprintln!("cd: missing argument");

continue;

}

let path = parts[1];

match env::set_current_dir(path) {

Ok(_) => {},

Err(e) => {

eprintln!("cd: {}: {}", path, e);

}

}

}

Wait, but the error message in the test example is "No such file or directory". In Rust, the error's description (e.to_string()) would be "No such file or directory (os error 2)" or similar. So maybe the code should check the error kind and format accordingly.

Wait, but in the test example, the error message is exactly "No such file or directory". So the code should output that exact string. However, the actual error message from the OS might vary. For example, on Unix systems, the error message for ENOENT is "No such file or directory". So in Rust, the io::Error for that case would have a message "No such file or directory".

So, using e.to_string() should give the correct message.

Testing this: if the path doesn't exist, env::set_current_dir returns an error with kind NotFound, and the error's to_string() is "No such file or directory".

So the code should be:

eprintln!("cd: {}: {}", path, e);

Which would format as "cd: /does_not_exist: No such file or directory", which matches the test example.

So, putting it all together:

Add 'cd' to the builtins list.

Add a match arm for "cd" that:

- Checks if there's an argument (path)

- Tries to change directory to that path

- Prints the error message in the specified format if it fails

Now, update the code accordingly.

But also, in the code, the main function returns an io::Result<()>, so using '?' would propagate errors. However, in the 'cd' arm, if env::set_current_dir returns an error, we need to handle it and print the message, not propagate the error (since the shell should continue running).

So, using a match statement to handle Ok and Err cases.

So, the code for the 'cd' arm would be:

"cd" => {

if parts.len() < 2 {

eprintln!("cd: missing argument");

continue;

}

let path = parts[1];

if let Err(e) = env::set_current_dir(path) {

eprintln!("cd: {}: {}", path, e);

}

}

Wait, but the problem's example shows the error message as "cd: /does_not_exist: No such file or directory", which is exactly what this code would produce if the error's to_string() is "No such file or directory".

So this should work.

Now, adding this to the code.

Let me check the existing code structure.

In the current code, after 'pwd' is handled, the 'cd' case should be added.

So, the match arms are:

"exit", "echo", "type", "pwd", then "cd", then '_'.

Yes.

So, in the code, after the 'pwd' arm, add:

"cd" => {

if parts.len() < 2 {

eprintln!("cd: missing argument");

continue;

}

let path = parts[1];

if let Err(e) = env::set_current_dir(path) {

eprintln!("cd: {}: {}", path, e);

}

}

But what if the user provides more than one argument? For example, 'cd /usr local'? The standard 'cd' command ignores extra arguments, taking the first one. So the code takes parts[1], which is the first argument, and ignores the rest. Which is correct.

Now, updating the builtins HashSet to include 'cd'.

So, in the main function:

let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type", "pwd", "cd"].iter().cloned().collect();

This way, when 'cd' is entered, it's matched in the 'cd' arm and handled correctly.

Testing the code:

- When 'cd /valid/path' is called, the directory is changed. The 'pwd' command will show the new directory.

- When 'cd /invalid/path' is called, the error message is printed.

- If no argument is given, 'cd' prints an error about missing argument. But according to the problem description, this stage may not test that, but including it is better for robustness.

But wait, the problem's test example includes the case where the user provides an invalid path, and the error message is printed. So the code should handle that.

Another thing to note: the code should not print anything on success. So, if the 'cd' command is successful, there's no output. The 'pwd' command is used to verify.

So, the code in the 'cd' arm does nothing on success, which is correct.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Add 'cd' to the builtins list.

2. Add a new match arm for 'cd' that checks the argument, changes directory, and handles errors.

Now, implement these changes in the code.
