Okay, let's see. I need to implement the 'type' builtin command for my shell. The user explained that 'type' should tell if a command is a shell builtin or not. From the examples given, when you type 'type echo', it should say 'echo is a shell builtin', and for an invalid command, it should say 'invalid_command: not found'.

First, I need to figure out which commands are considered builtins in my current shell. From the previous stages, I have 'exit', 'echo', and now 'type' itself. So those three are builtins. Any other command like 'invalid_command' should return not found.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Modify the existing code to recognize the 'type' command as a builtin.

2. When the 'type' command is called, check if the argument provided is one of the builtins.

3. If it is a builtin, print "<command> is a shell builtin".

4. If not, print "<command>: not found".

Looking at the existing code structure, there's a loop that reads input, splits it into parts, and matches the command. For each command, it checks if it's 'exit' or 'echo' and handles them. Now I need to add a case for 'type' and also handle when the command is 'type' followed by another command.

Wait, the 'type' command itself is a builtin. So when someone types 'type type', it should recognize that 'type' is a builtin.

So the builtins list now includes: exit, echo, type.

So first, I need to have a list or a way to check if a command is a builtin. Maybe a function or a HashSet containing the builtin commands.

In Rust, I can create a HashSet that contains "exit", "echo", "type". Then, when processing the 'type' command, check if the argument is in this set.

Here's how I can approach this:

- Create a set of builtin commands.

- When the command is 'type', take the next argument (the command to check).

- Check if that argument is in the builtins set.

- If yes, print the appropriate message.

- If no, print not found.

But how to handle cases where 'type' is called without an argument? According to the examples, the tester will send valid commands, but maybe I should handle that to avoid panics.

Also, need to make sure that the 'type' command itself is recognized as a builtin.

Let me think about modifying the existing match statement. Currently, the code matches on the command (parts[0]). For 'exit', 'echo', and now 'type', we need to handle them.

Wait, in the current code, after splitting the input into parts, the first part is the command. So for 'type echo', parts[0] is 'type', and parts[1] is 'echo'.

So in the match statement, when the command is 'type', we need to check the next argument (parts[1]) to see if it's a builtin.

So here's the plan:

1. Create a list or set of builtin commands: ["exit", "echo", "type"].

2. In the code where commands are processed, when the command is 'type', check the next argument.

3. If the next argument exists and is in the builtins set, print "<arg> is a shell builtin".

4. If the next argument exists but is not a builtin, print "<arg>: not found".

5. If there's no argument after 'type', maybe handle it as an error (but according to the notes, the tester will send valid commands, so maybe no need for extra handling now).

So modifying the code:

- Add a check for 'type' in the match command.

- For the 'type' case, get the argument (parts.get(1)), check if it's in the builtins.

Implementing this in Rust:

First, create a set of builtins:

let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type"].iter().cloned().collect();

Then, when handling the 'type' command:

if let Some(cmd) = parts.get(1) {

if builtins.contains(cmd) {

println!("{} is a shell builtin", cmd);

} else {

println!("{}: not found", cmd);

}

} else {

// handle case where 'type' is called without argument?

// According to the problem statement, the tester will provide valid commands, so maybe this isn't necessary now.

}

Wait, but in the examples given, when you type 'type invalid_command', it outputs 'invalid_command: not found'. So the code needs to handle when the command after 'type' is not a builtin.

So integrating this into the existing code structure.

In the current code, after splitting into parts, we have a match on parts[0], which is the command.

So modifying the match arms:

match command {

"exit" => { ... },

"echo" => { ... },

"type" => {

if parts.len() < 2 {

// handle missing argument, maybe print an error?

// but according to the tests, the tester will send valid commands, so maybe skip.

continue;

}

let cmd_to_check = parts[1];

if builtins.contains(cmd_to_check) {

println!("{} is a shell builtin", cmd_to_check);

} else {

println!("{}: not found", cmd_to_check);

}

}

_ => { ... }

}

But wait, the builtins set needs to be accessible within this match. So perhaps define it outside the loop, or inside the loop but before processing the command.

Wait, in Rust, if I define the builtins inside the loop, each iteration will recreate the set. It's more efficient to define it once. So maybe:

let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type"].iter().cloned().collect();

But in Rust, if this is inside the loop, each iteration will create the set. Alternatively, define it outside the loop.

But since the builtins are fixed, it's better to define it once. So outside the loop:

let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type"].into_iter().collect();

Wait, in Rust, to create a HashSet, you can do:

use std::collections::HashSet;

let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type"].iter().cloned().collect();

So integrating this into the code.

So modifying the code:

Add at the top:

use std::collections::HashSet;

Inside main(), before the loop:

let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type"].iter().cloned().collect();

Then, in the 'type' case:

"type" => {

if parts.len() < 2 {

// No argument provided, maybe print error? But tests may not check this.

// For now, just continue.

continue;

}

let cmd_to_check = parts[1];

if builtins.contains(cmd_to_check) {

println!("{} is a shell builtin", cmd_to_check);

} else {

println!("{}: not found", cmd_to_check);

}

}

This should handle the 'type' command.

Testing the examples:

- type echo → echo is in builtins → "echo is a shell builtin"

- type exit → exit is in builtins → "exit is a shell builtin"

- type type → type is in builtins → "type is a shell builtin"

- type invalid_command → not in builtins → "invalid_command: not found"

This matches the test cases.

Also, need to make sure that other commands like 'invalid_command' still print 'command not found'.

But in the existing code, after the match, the default case (_) is to print 'command not found'. Wait, no:

Looking at the current code structure, after splitting into parts and getting the command (parts[0]), the code matches on command:

match command {

"exit" => ...,

"echo" => ...,

"type" => ...,

_ => println!("{}: command not found", command),

}

So for any command not in the builtins (like 'invalid_command'), it will print 'command not found'.

But in the 'type' command's case, when we check for 'invalid_command', it's the argument to 'type', so 'type' is the command, and the argument is 'invalid_command'. So the code for 'type' will process it and print 'invalid_command: not found'.

Wait, no. When the user types 'type invalid_command', the command is 'type', which is processed in the 'type' match arm. The code checks parts[1], which is 'invalid_command', and since it's not in the builtins set, prints 'invalid_command: not found'.

So that's correct.

But when the user types 'invalid_command', the command is 'invalid_command', which falls into the _ case, printing 'invalid_command: command not found'.

Wait, according to the problem statement, the 'type' command's output for an unrecognized command should be '<command>: not found', whereas other commands (not builtins) should print '<command>: command not found'.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement examples:

$ type invalid_command

invalid_command: not found

But for a regular command that's not a builtin:

$ invalid_command

invalid_command: command not found

So the output messages are different depending on whether it's called via 'type' or as a regular command.

So the code currently, for 'invalid_command' typed directly, would print 'invalid_command: command not found' (from the _ case), and when typed as an argument to 'type', it would print 'invalid_command: not found'.

Which matches the test cases.

So this should be correct.

Now, integrating all this into the existing code.

Here's the modified code with 'type' support:

use std::collections::HashSet;

use std::io::{self, Write};

use std::process;

fn main() {

let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type"].iter().cloned().collect();

loop {

print!("$ ");

io::stdout().flush().expect("Failed to flush stdout");

let mut input = String::new();

match io::stdin().read_line(&mut input) {

Ok(0) => break,

Ok(_) => {}

Err(e) => {

eprintln!("Error: {}", e);

break;

}

}

let trimmed = input.trim();

if trimmed.is_empty() {

continue;

}

let parts: Vec<&str> = trimmed.split_whitespace().collect();

let command = parts[0];

match command {

"exit" => {

let exit_code = parts.get(1).and_then(|s| s.parse().ok()).unwrap_or(0);

process::exit(exit_code);

}

"echo" => {

let output = parts[1..].join(" ");

println!("{}", output);

}

"type" => {

if parts.len() < 2 {

// Handle missing argument, maybe print error?

// For the test cases, this might not be necessary.

continue;

}

let cmd_to_check = parts[1];

if builtins.contains(cmd_to_check) {

println!("{} is a shell builtin", cmd_to_check);

} else {

println!("{}: not found", cmd_to_check);

}

}

_ => {

println!("{}: command not found", command);

}

}

}

}

This code should handle all the test cases:

- 'type echo' → echo is a builtin → correct message

- 'type exit' → exit is a builtin → correct message

- 'type type' → type is a builtin → correct message

- 'type invalid_command' → invalid_command not found → correct message

- 'invalid_command' → command not found → correct message

- 'echo' works as before

- 'exit' works as before

Testing edge cases like 'type' without an argument: the code will check if parts.len() < 2, and continue. So it will not print anything and show the prompt again. But according to the problem statement, the tester will send valid commands, so this case might not be tested.

Another edge case: what if the user inputs 'type echo test' (more than one argument after type)? The code takes parts[1], which is 'echo', and ignores the rest. So it will print 'echo is a shell builtin', which is correct.

Yes, because the 'type' command in this context only checks the first argument. The problem statement examples show that 'type' is followed by a single command to check.

So this code should handle the requirements correctly.

**الحل النهائي:**

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;
use std::io::{self, Write};
use std::process;

fn main() {
    // قائمة بالأوامر المدمجة في الـ shell
    let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type"].iter().cloned().collect();

    loop {
        // عرض الـ prompt
        print!("$ ");
        io::stdout().flush().expect("فشل في إرسال البيانات");

        // قراءة الإدخال
        let mut input = String::new();
        match io::stdin().read_line(&mut input) {
            Ok(0) => break, // إنهاء عند الضغط على Ctrl+D
            Ok(_) => {}
            Err(e) => {
                eprintln!("خطأ: {}", e);
                break;
            }
        }

        let trimmed = input.trim();
        if trimmed.is_empty() {
            continue; // تجاهل الإدخال الفارغ
        }

        // تقسيم الإدخال إلى أجزاء
        let parts: Vec<&str> = trimmed.split_whitespace().collect();
        let command = parts[0];

        // معالجة الأوامر
        match command {
            "exit" => {
                let exit_code = parts.get(1).and_then(|s| s.parse().ok()).unwrap_or(0);
                process::exit(exit_code);
            }
            "echo" => {
                let output = parts[1..].join(" ");
                println!("{}", output);
            }
            "type" => {
                if parts.len() < 2 {
                    continue; // تجاهل إذا لم يُحدد أمر للفحص
                }
                let cmd_to_check = parts[1];
                if builtins.contains(cmd_to_check) {
                    println!("{} is a shell builtin", cmd_to_check);
                } else {
                    println!("{}: not found", cmd_to_check);
                }
            }
            _ => println!("{}: command not found", command),
        }
    }
}
```

**التوضيح خطوة بخطوة:**

1. **إنشاء قائمة بالأوامر المدمجة:**
   ```rust
   let builtins: HashSet<&str> = ["exit", "echo", "type"].iter().cloned().collect();
   ```
   - تخزن الأوامر المدمجة في مجموعة (HashSet) للبحث السريع.

2. **معالجة أمر `type`:**
   ```rust
   "type" => {
       if parts.len() < 2 { continue; }
       let cmd_to_check = parts[1];
       if builtins.contains(cmd_to_check) {
           println!("{} is a shell builtin", cmd_to_check);
       } else {
           println!("{}: not found", cmd_to_check);
       }
   }
   ```
   - يتحقق من وجود أمر ثانٍ بعد `type`.
   - إذا كان الأمر موجودًا في القائمة: يطبع أنه مدمج.
   - إذا لم يكن موجودًا: يطبع رسالة "not found".

3. **حالات خاصة:**
   - **`type type`:**  
     سيطبع `type is a shell builtin` لأن `type` مدرج في القائمة.
   - **`type invalid`:**  
     سيطبع `invalid: not found` لأن الأمر غير موجود في القائمة.

4. **التعامل مع باقي الأوامر:**
   - الأوامر غير المدرجة (مثل `ls`) ستطبع `command not found`.

---

**اختبارات التاكد:**

1. **أمر `type` مع أمر مدمج:**
   ```
   $ type echo
   echo is a shell builtin
   ```

2. **أمر `type` مع أمر غير موجود:**
   ```
   $ type invalid_cmd
   invalid_cmd: not found
   ```

3. **أمر `type` مع نفسه:**
   ```
   $ type type
   type is a shell builtin
   ```

4. **أوامر أخرى غير مدمجة:**
   ```
   $ ls
   ls: command not found
   ```

**ملاحظات أداء:**
- استخدام `HashSet` يجعل البحث عن الأوامر المدمجة سريعًا (O(1)).
- التعامل مع الحالات الحدية (مثل الإدخال بدون وسيطات) بشكل آمن.
